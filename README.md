# NOH101

### Summary

A simple polyphonic synthesizer, using analog-style subtractive synthesis as the
basis and taking basic architectural and visual inspiration from the classic
Roland SH line of synthesizers from the 1970s and 1980s (especially the SH101).

### MVP

[ ] A clean, clear design that visually emulates the look of the Roland SH101 synthesiszer
[ ] A single oscillator sound-source, with individual gain amounts for Square, Triange and Sawtooth waves
[ ] The ability to play the instrument using the computer keyboard over a single octave (accidental keys too)
[ ] A simple resonant lowpass filter
[ ] A simple amplifier/gain control
[ ] A single ADSR envelope, linkable to both the filter cutoff and amplifier gain
[ ] A triangle-wave LFO, linkable to both the filter cutoff and the amplifier gain
[ ] A very simple sequencer/looper
